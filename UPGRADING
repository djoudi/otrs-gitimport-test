These instructions are for people upgrading OTRS from "1.0" to "1.1".

*) Stop all your services (e. g. rcotrs stop-force)

*) Backup everything (database, Kernel/Config.pm, Kernel/Config/*.pm, var/*)

*) Make sure that you have backed up everything ,-)

*) If possible try this install on a separate machine, althoug
   I had always only production machines to upgrade

*) Install the new release (tar or RPM)

*) If you use the tar, updated your webserver setup e.g. httpd.conf with
   [...]
   Alias /otrs-web/ "/opt/otrs/var/httpd/htdocs/"
   [...]
   for the OTRS images.

*) Update the database changes with:
    MySQL: 
      cat $OTRS_HOME/scripts/DBUpdate-to-1.1.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs
    PostgreSQL:
      cat $OTRS_HOME/scripts/DBUpdate-to-1.1.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

   (Don't worry about the error messages, you can update all previous version
   with this script and in the most cases your database has already the most changes!)

*) Execute $OTRS_HOME/bin/SetPermissions.sh !

*) Restart your services (e. g. rcotrs restart-force or each service manually)
