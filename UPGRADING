These instructions are for people upgrading OTRS from "3.1" to "3.2",
and applies both for RPM and source code (tarball) upgrades.

If you are running a lower version of OTRS you have to follow the upgrade path
to 3.1 first (1.1->1.2->1.3->2.0->2.1->2.2->2.3->2.4->3.0->3.1->3.2 ...)!

Please note that if you upgrade from OTRS 2.2 or earlier, you have to
take an extra step; please read http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6798

Within a single minor version you can skip patch level releases if you want to
upgrade. For instance you can upgrade directly from OTRS 3.2.1 to version
3.2.4. If you need to do such a "patch level upgrade", you should skip steps
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXYZ.


1) Stop all relevant services
   --------------------------

    e. g. (depends on used services):

    shell> /etc/init.d/cron stop
    shell> /etc/init.d/postfix stop
    shell> /etc/init.d/apache stop


2) Backup everything below $OTRS_HOME (default: OTRS_HOME=/opt/otrs)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

    o Kernel/Config.pm
    o Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm
    o Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAuto.pm
    o var/*
    o as well as the database


3) Make sure that you have backed up everything ;-)
   ------------------------------------------------

4) Setup new system (optional)
   ---------------------------

   If possible try this install on a separate machine for testing first.


5) Install the new release (tar or RPM)
   ------------------------------------

   With the tarball:

    shell> cd /opt
    shell> tar -xzf otrs-x.x.x.tar.gz
    shell> ln -s otrs-x.x.x otrs

    Restore old configuration files.
    o Kernel/Config.pm
    o Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm
    o Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAuto.pm


   With the RPM:

    shell> rpm -Uvh otrs-x.x.x.-01.rpm

    In this case the RPM update automatically restores the old configuration files.

6) Own themes
   ----------

   Note: The OTRS themes between 3.1 and 3.2 are NOT compatible, so don't use your old themes!

   Themes are located under $OTRS_HOME/Kernel/Output/HTML/*/*.dtl (default: OTRS_HOME=/opt/otrs)


7) Set file permissions
   --------------------

   If the tarball is used, execute:

     shell> cd /opt/otrs/
     shell> bin/otrs.SetPermissions.pl

   with the permissions needed for your system setup.


8) Apply the database changes
   --------------------------

     shell> cd /opt/otrs/


    SCHEMA UPDATE PART 1:
    =====================

    MySQL:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs

    PostgreSQL 8.2+:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

    PostgreSQL, older versions:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2.postgresql_before_8_2.sql | psql otrs


    NOTE: If you use PostgreSQL 8.1 or earlier, you need to activate the new legacy driver
    for these older versions. Do this by adding a new line to your Kernel/Config.pm like this:

    $Self->{DatabasePostgresqlBefore82} = 1;


    DATABASE MIGRATION SCRIPT
    =========================

    shell> scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2.pl

    Do not continue the upgrading process if this script did not work properly for you.
    Otherwise data loss may occur.


    SCHEMA UPDATE PART 2:
    =====================

    MySQL:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2-post.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs

    PostgreSQL 8.2+:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2-post.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

    PostgreSQL, older versions:
     shell> cat scripts/DBUpdate-to-3.2-post.postgresql_before_8_2.sql | psql otrs


9) Refresh the configuration cache and delete caches
    -------------------------------------------------

    Please run:

    shell> bin/otrs.RebuildConfig.pl
    shell> bin/otrs.DeleteCache.pl


10) Restart your services
    ---------------------

    e. g. (depends on used services):

    shell> /etc/init.d/apache start
    shell> /etc/init.d/postfix start
    shell> /etc/init.d/cron start

    Now you can log into your system.


11) Check installed packages
    ------------------------
    In the package manager, check if all packages are still marked as
    correctly installed or if any require reinstallation or even a package upgrade.


12) Cleanup metadata of archived tickets
    ------------------------------------
    Note: This step only applies if you use the ticket archiving feature of OTRS.

    With OTRS 3.2, when tickets are archived, the information which agent read the
    ticket and articles can be removed, as well as the ticket subscriptions of agents.
    This is active by default and helps reduce the amount of data in the database on
    large systems with many tickets and agents.

    If you also want to cleanup this information for existing archived tickets,
    please run this script:

    shell> bin/otrs.CleanupTicketMetadata.pl --archived

    If you want to KEEP this information instead, please set these
    SysConfig settings to "No":

    Ticket::ArchiveSystem::RemoveSeenFlags
    Ticket::ArchiveSystem::RemoveTicketWatchers


13) Well done!
