These instructions are for people upgrading OpenTRS to a newer release.

*) Stop all your services (e. g. rcotrs stop-force)

*) Backup everything (database, Kernel/Config.pm, var/*)

*) Make sure that you have backed up everything ,-)

*) If possible try this install on a separate machine, althoug
   I had always only production machines to upgrade

*) Install the new release (tar or RPM)

*) Update the database changes with:
    MySQL: 
      cat $OTRS_HOME/scripts/DBUpdate.mysql.sql | mysql -f -u root otrs
    PostgreSQL:
      cat $OTRS_HOME/scripts/DBUpdate.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

*) Update the new Kernel/Config.pm with your setting (use the newer 
   Kernel/Config.pm - normally new releases have more config settings)

*) Restart your services (e. g. rcotrs restart-force or each service manually)
