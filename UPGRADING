These instructions are for people upgrading OTRS from "2.0" to "2.1".

*) Stop all your services (e. g. rcotrs stop-force)

*) Backup everything (database, Kernel/Config.pm, Kernel/Config/GenericAgent.pm, var/*)
   (Remember: 80% of all config settings are renamed in OTRS 2.0, so most of the
   Kernel/Config.pm settings will not be compatible)

*) Make sure that you have backed up everything ,-)

*) If possible try this install on a separate machine, althoug
   I had always only production machines to upgrade

*) Install the new release (tar or RPM)

*) If you use the tar:

    a) the otrs themes between 2.0 and 2.1 may are _not_ compatible
       (don't us the old theme)!

*) Update the database changes with:
    MySQL:
      cat $OTRS_HOME/scripts/DBUpdate-to-2.1.mysql.sql | mysql -p -f -u root otrs
    PostgreSQL:
      cat $OTRS_HOME/scripts/DBUpdate-to-2.1.postgresql.sql | psql otrs

   (Don't worry about the error messages, you can update all previous version
   with this script and in the most cases your database has already the most changes!)

*) Execute $OTRS_HOME/bin/SetPermissions.sh !

*) Restart your services (e. g. rcotrs restart-force or each service manually)
