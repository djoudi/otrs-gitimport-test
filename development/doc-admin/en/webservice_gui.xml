        The web service graphical user interface (GUI) is a great tool that allow us to construct
        complex web service configurations in a friendly and nice interface, with it is possible to:

        <para>
            The "Web Services" link in the main screen of Admin Interface (in the System
            Administration box) leads to the web services overview screen, where you are able to
            manage your web service configurations. You can add new web services or change the
            configuration for the existing ones from this screen.
        </para>
        <para>
            Every web service configuration screen has in the upper part of the screen a navigation
            path in a "bread crumbs" style. This navigation path is useful to know exactly in which
            part of the web service configuration we are, and also we can jump back to any level of
            the configuration at any time (this action will not save any changes).

                To create a new web service, press the button "Add web service", and provide the

            The only required field in this part is the web service "Name" that needs to be unique

                Returning to the web service change screen, now we are going to review the right
                side of it, where we have the possibility to modify all the general data for a web
                service like, name, description, debug threshold, etc. Also there are two more
                sections below that allows us to modify specific parameters for both communication
                types "OTRS as Provider" and "OTRS as Requester".
            </para>
            <para>
                The web service configuration needs to be saved on each level, this means that if a
                setting is changed, links to other deeper parts of the configuration will be
                disabled forcing to save the current configuration level. After saving the disabled
                links will be re-enabled again allowing you to continue with the configuration.
            </para>
            <para>
                On the "OTRS as provider" section it is possible to set or configure the network
                transport protocol, only previously registered network transport backends are shown
                on the list. To configure the network transport click on the "Configure" button.
                It is also possible to add new operations in this box, to do this select one of the
                available operations from the "Add Operation" list, this will lead you to the
                operation configuration screen. After saving the new operation it will be listed on
                the table above.
            </para>
            <para>
                "OTRS as requester" is very similar to the previous one, but instead of operations
                you are able to add invokers

                In future the available network transport list will be increased, currently only
                "HTTP::SOAP" transport is available. each transport has different configuration
                options to setup and they might use different frontend modules to configure it, but
                they should look similar to the "HTTP::SOAP" transport configuration module.
            </para>
            <para>
                For "HTTP::SOAP" protocol as provider the configuration is quite simple,
                there are only two settings "Namespace" and "Maximum message length" this fields
                are required. The first one is a URI to give SOAP methods a context, reducing
                ambiguities, and the second one it's a field where you can specify the maximum size
                (in bytes) for SOAP messages that OTRS will process.

                The actions that can be performed when you are using OTRS as a provider are called
                "Operations", each operation belongs to a controller (controllers are
                collections of operations or invokers), normally operations from the same
                controller need similar settings and shares the same configuration dialog. But each
                operation can have independent configuration dialogs (if need it).

            <para>
                Name, Description, Backend, and Mappings are fields that normally appear on every

                Remote System GUID field in SolMan Controller operations.
            </para>
            <para>
                Normally there are two mapping configuration sections on each operation, one for the
                incoming data and another one for the outgoing data, you can choose different
                mapping types (backends) for each mapping way, since they configuration is
                independent from each other and also independent from the operation backend. The
                normal and most common practice is that the operation uses same mapping type in
                both cases (with inverted configuration). The complete mapping configuration is
                done in a separated screen, that depends on the mapping type.

                The actions that can be performed when you are using OTRS as a requester are called
                "Invokers", each invoker belongs to a controller (controllers are collections of
                operations or invokers), normally invokers from the same controller need similar
                settings and shares the same configuration dialog. But each invoker can have
                independent configuration dialogs (if need it).
            </para>
            <para>
                Name, Description, Backend, and Mappings are fields that normally appear on every
                invoker, as well as the list of event triggers other special fields can appear on
                non default configuration dialogs like Remote System GUID field in SolMan
                Controller invokers.

            <para>
                Event triggers are events within OTRS like "TicketCreate", "ArticleSend", etc. That
                act as triggers to execute the invoker. Each invoker needs to have at least one
                event trigger registered, or the invoker will be useless (because it will never be
                called). The asynchronous property of the event triggers define if the OTRS process
                will handle the invoker or if it will be delegated to the Scheduler.

                <para>
                    OTRS Scheduler is a separated process that execute tasks in the background, in
                    this way the OTRS process will not be affected if the Remote System takes a long
                    time to respond, if is not available or if there are network problems,
                    otherwise it will looks like OTRS is slow or non responsive. This is why is
                    highly recommend to use asynchronous event triggers always

                To add an Event trigger first select the event family from the first list, then the
                event name from the second list, then set the asynchronous property (if unchecked
                means that the event trigger will not be asynchronous) and then click on the plus
