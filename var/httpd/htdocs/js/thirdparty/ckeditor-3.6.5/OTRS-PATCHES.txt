# A list of all patches applied to CKEditor for OTRS.
# --

Patches to be applied:

-   _source/plugins/image/dialogs/2010-10-28-image-dialog.patch
    OTRS Bug#4503: Removes Border Option from Image Dialog

-   After that, copy _sources/plugins/image/dialogs/image.js to
    plugins/image/dialogs/image.js to make sure the patched version is
    also used in CKEditor.

-   _source/plugins/dialogui/2010-10-28-dialogui.patch
    Adds additional hidden fields to the image upload

After applying the fixes, run ckpackager to compile a new ckeditor.js as
layed out here: http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/CKPackager

Content which does not need patching on update:

-   Note that _sources/plugins/aspell is already a patched plugin
    which is taken over from a previous CKEditor folder of OTRS. This
    only needs patching if the plugin itself would have to be updated.

-   Note that skins/default is a patched version of the kama skin
    with a new icon set and some changed widths and dropdown sizes.
