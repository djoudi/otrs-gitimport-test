This install way is intended for <ulink url="http://www.suse.de/"><citetitle>SuSE Linux</citetitle></ulink> users. For other distributions please have a look at <ulink url="http://www.otrs.org/"><citetitle>http://www.otrs.org/</citetitle></ulink>.

Install the otrs.rpm with YaST (YaST2) or rpm what ever you prefer. Please be aware of the fact that OpenTRS needs some Perl-Modules which are not installed by default in a typical SuSE installation. In case you use YaST you will not have troubles because YaST will tell you what packages have to be installed.

Once you installed the otrs.rpm in your system you have to reload the apache by rcapache reload to force him to reload the config file.
