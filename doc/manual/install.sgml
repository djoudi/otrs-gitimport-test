<title>Install the biest.</title>
<para>
The described way of installing the otrs is tested on a newly installed system. In case you have trouble to install it on your working system please try it with a new Linux installation. Most of the installation problems are caused by messy apache configurations and forgotten mysql database passwords. So please use a fresh installation to encircle an installation problem in case it occures.
</para>
<para>
We try to keep the installation as easy as possible. But the OTRS is a very powerfull and complex application which can not just be untared in some directory and that's it.

<title>Installing the rpm on a SuSE Linux (the quick and easy way)</title>
<para>
This section is a guide for installing OTRS on a SuSE Linux. We tested the SuSE Linux versions 7.3, 8.0 and 8.1. Before starting the installation have a look at <ulink url="http://www.otrs.org/"><citetitle>http://otrs.org/</citetitle></ulink> and check if a newer and better version of the rpm file is available. If so please download it and use the newer documentation and the newer rpm.
</para>
<para>
Install the otrs.rpm with YaST (YaST2) or on the command line with rpm (what ever you prefer). Please be aware of the fact that OTRS needs some Perl-Modules which are not installed by default in a typical SuSE installation. So it might be a good idea to use YaST to install the rpm because it will handle and solve all the dependencies.
</para>
<para>
In case you prefer the command line rpm way (you have to have installed the needed modules first otherwise rpm will ask you to do so):
<screen>
ernie:~ # rpm -ivh /tmp/otrs.rpm 
otrs                        ##################################################
Check OTRS user (/etc/passwd)... otrs exists.

Next steps: 

[SuSEconfig]
 Execute 'SuSEconfig' to configure the webserver.

[start Apache and MySQL]
 Execute 'rcapache restart' and 'rcmysql start' in case they don't run.

[install the OTRS database]
 Use a webbrowser and open this link:
 http://localhost/otrs/installer.pl

[OTRS services]
 Start OTRS 'rcotrs start-force' (rcotrs {start|stop|status|restart|start-force|stop-force}).

Have fun!

Know it's time to start SuSEconfig:

Once you installed the otrs.rpm on your system you have to restart the apache by rcapache restart to force apache to reload the config file. 
<screen>
ernie:~ # rcapache restart
Shutting down httpd                                         done

Now you have to setup the databases. Please open <ulink url="http://localhost/otrs/installer.pl"><citetitle>http://localhost/otrs/installer.pl</citetitle></ulink> to do so.

It is not a good idea to use the default passwords. You install a very important piece of software and you do not want anybody to be able to hack your database just because you didn't change the default password!
