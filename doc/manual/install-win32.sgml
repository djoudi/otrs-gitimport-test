<section id="download_and_installation_otrs4win32">
<title>Download &amp; Installation</title>
<para>Download the current release - you may use our <ulink url="http://otrs.org/download">http://otrs.org/download</ulink> as a starting point. 
It's an executable .exe file, it's name follows this conventions: <emphasis>otrs4win32-&lt;OTRS-VERSION&gt;-&lt;STATUS&gt;.exe</emphasis>. You may also want to verify the corresponding md5 sum after download - find it besides the files on the servers. We herefore recommend md5-summer: <ulink url="http://md5summer.org/">http://md5summer.org/</ulink>. Give it a try, it's a fine piece of GPL software.</para>
<para>Obtain administrative rights on your box by logging in as an administrator or by using "Run as...". Start the installer.
</para>
<para>
The first step the software will take is verifying its own integrity. Depending on the speed of your machine, you will probably not see this, but it's there:

<graphic srccredit="Verifying otrs4win32 - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-verifying.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
There's no interactivity required by you in this step.
</para>
<para>Following you may choose the desired language. <emphasis>Please note</emphasis> that this does not affect your OTRS installation later on, but only sets the language used throughout the installer. Yes, we are thinking of connecting both settings. Please note additionally it might be we didn't already translate your language. In that case, the installer will default to english. Feel free to <ulink url="mailto:contact@otrs.org">contact us</ulink> if you'd like to contribute a translation to your language.

Please be patient now for a little while, while the installer is unpacking its contents. Remember, the resulting installation will roughly be about fourth times the installer's size, so it might take a while for the next screen to appear.
</para>
<para>It will open in full-screen mode. We omitted the coloured background in this documentation, only the dialogue windows are shown.</para>
<para>Please read the precautions carefully:

<graphic srccredit="Components otrs4win32 - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-components.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
We provide different installation types, which are available in a 'service' and a 'non-service' version. We strongly recommend choosing the latter from the drop-down field at the top, which is the default, anyway:
<itemizedlist mark='opencircle'>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Full (recommended!)</emphasis>: The name says it: this installs all of the delivered software and it is our recommendation. We mainly support this one, ie. you are strongly encouraged to choose it.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis>Minimum</emphasis>: Choosing this will only install those components that are absolutely required to get the basic OTRS system going, omitting all the gimmicks this bundle additionally provides. If in a customized installation (see below) you omit one of them, OTRS won't work. So it's best to start from here with customization, if ever.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Additionally to the above options, you may choose your own set of components, allowing you to customize the installation as you like. The drop-down field will change to "Customized" then, and you can reset your selection by choosing one of the other types again. When creating your own, customized installation, you notice that some components always have to be installed to get anything going - their checkmarks are greyed out.
<warning>
<para>
Please do *not* expect everything working fine if you did not choose "Full" installation. This will esp. apply to the provided html-pages outside OTRS.
</para>
</warning>
</para>
<para>
It's time to wisely choose the top-level installation directory. All files of otrs4win32 are kept under this one (see the FAQ for more info on this if you feel this is an issue). The below screenshot, showing a part of a particular Start Menu, will most likely look different on your box.
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Choose Install Location - otrs4win32</screeninfo>
<graphic srccredit="Choose Install Location - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-location.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
<warning>
<para>
We <emphasis>strongly recommend</emphasis> locating the directory directly in the root of any drive, as shown above.
</para>
</warning>
</para>
<para>If you'd like to have some links in your Windows' Start Menu to manage the installation, you may choose the right one here.
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Start Menu - otrs4win32</screeninfo>
<graphic srccredit="Start Menu - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-startmenu.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
We again <emphasis>strongly recommend</emphasis> creating these entries. They do no harm and prevent you from having to fiddle with the start/stop and administrative skripts from otrs4win32's various subdirectories.</para>
<para>This is an example screen of otrs4win32 performing the actual install.

Please be patient. In the meantime get some coffee and/or click on 'Show Details' to watch the output of the installer:
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Installing (showing details) - otrs4win32</screeninfo>
<graphic srccredit="Installing (showing details) - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-installing_details.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
</para>
<para>
During this process, you may feel the installation does nothing until Apache's service installation fails, showing this output:
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Safely ignore this output - otrs4win32</screeninfo>
<graphic srccredit="Safely ignore this output - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-safely_ignore.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
Don't panic at this point - Apache's service installation will most likely have succeeded! We're working on this issue.</para>
<para>Once the external configuration routine is finished, you will be returned to the installer's screen. After some finishing steps it should look similar to this:
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Complete - otrs4win32</screeninfo>
<graphic srccredit="Complete - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-complete.png"></graphic>

<screenshot>
<screeninfo>Finished - otrs4win32</screeninfo>
<graphic srccredit="Complete - screenshot" scale="40" fileref="screenshots/otrs4win32-finished.png"></graphic>
</screenshot>
No reboot should be required. Please read on before clicking 'Finish'!
</para>
<warning>
<title>Installation and Upgrade Issues</title>
<para>This release is suitable only for OTRS systems that are about to be freshly installed, ie. you are currently not encouraged to upgrade your existing OTRS installation. In fact, the installer does not provide any mechanism to do so.</para>
</warning>
</section>

<section id="start_otrs_on_win32">
<title>Start The OTRS System</title>
<para>
Make sure there are no other server applications running on the ports 25 (smtp), 80 (http), 443 (https), 3306 (MySQL). If so, find out, what servers they are and if they are supposed and/or required to run at this time on your machine. Examples were Microsoft's IIS webserver running silently in the background or the correspnding SMTP service. You'll have to shut them down to start OTRS. A latter version of this installer will do all of the above for you.
</para>
<para>
To start your system's servers now, you may use the provided option on the finishing page of the installer dialogue labeled 'Run otrs4win32'. This does the same as the Start Menu entry 'Start All Servers' in the section "Services" (see below), namely executing the script 'all_startservices.bat' located in the root directory of otrs4win32. By default, all servers needed for OTRS are installed as services.
</para>
<para>
Please be so patient to wait a little while until Apache has been completely starting up, and then visit <userinput>http://localhost/</userinput>. This is XAMPP and its components - you'll find OTRS in the left-hand menu. Click on it to get to the informational page about OTRS. The link at the bottom points to <userinput>http://localhost/otrs/cgi-bin/index.pl</userinput>. Click it - there you go! You can reach the resulting page, which is OTRS' Login Page directly by clicking the coresponding link in OTRS' Start Menu.</para>
</section>

<section id="how_to_stop_the_servers_otrs4win32">
<title>How To Stop The Servers (if ever...)</title>
<para>If you installed the servers as system services, you may use the system's service control area to stop them, although you don't need to, because they will be terminated at shutdown time properly. Additionally, they need not be shut down if you actually do not work in OTRS, but should be kept running to let the maintenance scripts perform their actions at their given times.</para>
<para>Regarding the Standalone versions of the servers: For Apache, you may simply close it's control window. To safely shut down MySQL, use it's Start Menu entry or issue the script <userinput>mysql_stop.bat</userinput>. Shut down Mercury via it's <userinput>file</userinput> menu or the keyboard shortcut <userinput>Alt-F4</userinput> when the Mercury window has the focus. Stop the CRONw service via the Start Menu or by issuing <userinput>net stop cron</userinput>.</para>
</section>

<section id="uninstallation_otrs4win32">
<title>Uninstallation Instructions</title>
<para>If you ever want to remove otrs4win32 from your box, simply stop all of the servers, uninstall all of their eventually installed services and delete the directory holding the application. For all this we provide an uninstaller, found in the installation directory. You may perform some of the required steps manually via the Start Menu, if you want to.</para>
<para>The uninstall process will guide you through what will be uuninstalled. No Reboot should be required.</para>
<para>Additionally, it provides some means to actually <emphasis>RE</emphasis>install some aspects of the software. This were the service, the Start menu entries and the  entries in Windows' Registry.</para>

<section id="step_by_step_manual_win32_installation">
<title>Step-by-Step: The Manual Installation</title>
<para>This section of the installation instruction set deals step-by-step with installing OTRS manually on systems running <emphasis>Win32</emphasis>. Of course we do recomend the usage of our otrs4win32 Installer. It is much easier to use!</para>

<section id="needed_software">
<title>Needed Software</title>
<para>You will need three main components on your system, a webserver (<ulink url="http://apache.org/">Apache</ulink>), a database (<ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</ulink>) and the programming language <ulink url="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</ulink>.</para>
<para>The whole installation will assumingly take place on drive D:, but you may install wherever you like, for sure. All you have to do is replace every occurence of <emphasis>D:</emphasis> or <emphasis>d:</emphasis> with your choice, f.e. <emphasis>c:\Programs</emphasis>. It is *no* good idea to have spaces in the installation path, so <emphasis>c:\program Files\otrs</emphasis> won't be a lucky choice.</para>

<section id="installing_the_webserver">
<title>Installing The Webserver</title>
<para>OTRS requires a webserver to run. You may choose the one of your choice, it will probably run on every perl-enabled webserver. I tested it on <ulink url="http://www.sambar.org">Sambar</ulink> <ulink url="http://sambar.robertkehl.de">5.2 &amp; above</ulink> and on <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</ulink>, both <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/">1.3</ulink> and <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/">2.0</ulink>. <computeroutput>mod_perl</computeroutput> is only availabe for Apache. Currently, only mod_perl-1.0 on Apache 1.3.27 is covered in these instructions.</para>

<section id="installing_apache">
<title>Installing Apache</title>

<para>Download the <ulink url="http://www.apache.org">Apache</ulink> of your choice (<ulink url="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_1.3.27-win32-x86-no_src.msi">1.3.27</ulink> and/or <ulink url="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.43-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi">2.0.43</ulink>) and install it/them. I recommend you choose <userinput>D:\Apache</userinput> as root for *both* versions. The resulting directory structure will be:</para>
<para><screen>
<computeroutput>D:\Apache\</computeroutput>           --- home of both
<computeroutput>D:\Apache\Apache\</computeroutput>    --- home of Apache 1.3
<computeroutput>D:\Apache\Apache2\</computeroutput>   --- home of Apache 2.0
</screen></para><tip>
<para>You may install both 1.3 and 2.0 on the very same machine, they can both be running and may both be used at the same time, if you like to. All you have to do is to ensure they are not configured to run on the same port. The second installation willing to start on port 80 won't succeed in doing so. So configure Apache 1.3 to run on port 80, Apache 2.0 to run on port 81. You could even configure the Sambar webserver (see different section in this manual) to run on port 82, if you'd like to, or choose your own port configuration. Surely one webserver running one version would be enough - the rest is for geeks ;)</para>

Start it. Not thoroughly tested in this manual installation procedure is MySQL Version 4.0 - but as it is included in the automatic installer you may give this version a try instead of the older 3.23.</para>
<para>For a more comfortable configuration interface I recommend installing phpMyAdmin from <ulink url="http://www.phpmyadmin.net">http://www.phpmyadmin.net</ulink>, too, location: <emphasis>D:\mysql\phpMyAdmin</emphasis>.

<title>A note about your FQDN</title>
<para>This is the called <emphasis>Full Qulified Domain Name</emphasis> of your PC, just like your IP adress it's unique across the universe ...ah... internet, I mean. If you're using a dial-up line to connect to the internet, your FQDN will always be a different one each time you dial anew. This is indeed ok for OTRS, but it's not nice if exim announces itself with a wrong name. It can lead to difficulties in mail delivery.</para>
<para> To solve this problem you can use so called <emphasis>Dynamic DNS services</emphasis> like <ulink url="http://www.dyndns.org/">http://www.dyndns.org/</ulink>. By using a client such as <emphasis>DirectUpdate </emphasis>(<ulink url="http://www.directupdate.net/">http://www.directupdate.net/</ulink>) you submit your IP adress to <emphasis>dyndns.org</emphasis> each times it changes and can thereby obtain a FQDN, for example <emphasis>gogos-pc.home-ip.net</emphasis>. You can even forward your domain <emphasis>http://www.thisismydomain.com/</emphasis> to your home PC. If you got further questions concerning Dynamic DNS services, <ulink url="mailto:otrs-win32@robertkehl.de?subject=Dynamic%20DNS">don't hesitate to ask</ulink> - but now back to OTRS :)</para>

<title>The First Start</title>
<para>(Re-)Start your Apache installation(s) using the Apache monitor, proabably located in your task bar. Sometimes it's a good idea to restart the whole box.</para>
<para>Now see OTRS in action for the first time. Call <emphasis>http://localhost/otrs/index.pl</emphasis> in your favourite browser.</para>
<para>The user name is &quot;root@localhost&quot;, the password is &quot;root&quot;, both without the quotes.</para>

<para>You set your system email addresses here: <ulink url="http://localhost/otrs/index.pl?Action=AdminSystemAddress">http://localhost/otrs/index.pl?Action=AdminSystemAddress</ulink>. These are the addresses your customers lateron use to reach your OTRS.</para>

<para>Please note that Apache cannot CRON.

<title>Beginner's Help: Command Boxes</title>
<para>Throughout this document, we will need to enter commands directly into the system quite often. We do this in a so called <emphasis>command box</emphasis>. Other names are <emphasis>command line</emphasis>, <emphasis>(DOS) prompt</emphasis> or <emphasis>shell</emphasis>. Here is how to invoke a command box on Windows:</para>
<para>Click <emphasis>Start</emphasis>, then <emphasis>Execute</emphasis> and enter <userinput>cmd</userinput> in the dialogue box popping up. Hit <userinput>Return</userinput> on your keyboard or click <emphasis>OK</emphasis>. A (usually black) box appears - if it doesn't, you're not on a 32-bit system. The box will be showing something similar to this:</para>

<para>This will bring you to your OTRS executable directory and show it's contents. The <emphasis>/d</emphasis> switch tells Windows to also change the drive letter, if necessary, i.e. to directly switch to the given directory, even over partition boundaries.</para>
<para>Please note that this is a <emphasis>sample output only</emphasis>, and it's from my box, a german Windows 2000 installation, as you see. It will probably (hopefully!) look different on your box.</para>
<para>You can customize the appearance of command boxes by clicking in the upper left corner of the window and choosing <userinput>Properties</userinput>. This were esp. useful for the default colors and sizes of your command boxes.</para>
<para>It will help if you get a little bit comfortable with command boxes and working from the command line in general. <ulink url="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;newwindow=1&amp;q=%22command+line%22+%22learning+resources%22+windows">Search with Google for help with command lines</ulink>.</para>
