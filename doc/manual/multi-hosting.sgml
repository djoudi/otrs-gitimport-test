<title>Multi Group</title>
<para>
This is an example setup for one company with a helpdesk, sales and billing 
department. Each department should not see tickets of the other department. 
This means nobody from helpdesk should have access to the billing tickets.
Nobody the one department can access to a queue of the others.
</para>
<para>
Add the following to Kernel/Config.pm
<programlisting>
    # MoveInToAllQueues -> useful for ASP
    # (Possible to move in all queue? Not only queue which
    # the own groups) [1|0]
    $Self->{MoveInToAllQueues} = 0;

    # ChangeOwnerToEveryone -> useful for ASP
    # (Possible to change owner of ticket ot everyone) [0|1]
    $Self->{ChangeOwnerToEveryone} = 0;

    # ShowCustomerSelection
    # (show customer selection in phone and change customer view
    # - disable this for ASP!) [0|1]
    $Self->{ShowCustomerSelection} = 0;

    # PhoneViewASP -> useful for ASP
    # (Possible to create in all queue? Not only queue which 
    # the own groups) [0|1]
    $Self->{PhoneViewASP} = 1;

<title>System email addresses (1/2)</title>
<para>
You need to add new system email addresses for each
department (e. g. helpdesk@example.com, sales@example.com and billing@example.com). 
Note: You can't set the right queue because you need to create the queue at first -
this will be done later.
</para>

billing-raw and billing-claim and set the group of each queue to the right.
</para>

(e. g. helpdesk@example.com, sales@example.com and billing@example.com) with the

<title>Note</title>
<para>
If you add one user of the departments to the admin group, then the user can
change all settings of the system. Means the user can also add/modify user/response/...
of the other groups. -=> Normally this admin changes should be done by an admin.
