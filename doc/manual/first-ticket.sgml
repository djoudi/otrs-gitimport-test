<title>How can somebody write e-mails to the OpenTRS?</title>
<para>
The default installation will accept e-mails to the e-mail address <email>otrs@localhost</email>. This is good to start a little playing. Use your favorate e-mail client and send an e-mail to this address (of course you have to be on this system). Or you can have a look in the admin section of OpenTRS to add different e-mail addresses like <email>info@foo.org</email>. But please take care that these e-mails will be delivered to the local otrs account! In case you are not familiar with the configuration of your sendmail or postfix have a look in the man-pages or send an e-mail to the <link linkend="mailinglists">mailinglist</link> <email>otrs@otrs.org</email>.

<para><emphasis role='bold'>Config of sendmail in SuSE Linux</emphasis></para>
<para>
Ok, ok, ... we show you a simple example. Lets presume you have a plain SuSE Linux installation with sendmail as a default Mail Transfer Agent and you want to set up a OpenTRS e-mail account for the e-mail address <email>info@example.com</email>. All you have to do is to add a line to your /etc/mail/virtusertable file. 
</para>

<programlisting>
# /etc/mail/virtusertable

# Description:
#
#  A domain-specific form of aliasing, allowing multiple virtual
#  domains to be hosted on one machine.
#
# Examples:
#
#info@foo.com            foo-info
#info@bar.com            bar-info
#joe@bar.com             error:nouser No such user here
#jax@bar.com             error:D.S.N:unavailable Address invalid
#@baz.org                jane@example.net
#

info@example.com         otrs
support@example.com      otrs
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
That's it (we actually added a second e-mail address with the name <email>support@example.com</email>! You have to run SuSEconfig.

<para>
Now all incoming e-mails to info@example.com will be delivers to the local user otrs.
</para>
<para>
Every e-mail to the user otrs will be handled by the procmail-rule of otrs which pipes the e-mail to the system. You will find the e-mail in the RAW queue.
