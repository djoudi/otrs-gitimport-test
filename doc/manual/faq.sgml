</question>

OTRS is working with database id references. If you would delete a user

<question>
<para>
Can I use OTRS only with SuSE Linux?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
No, but we developed it on a SuSE Linux and frankly we did not do much testing on a Redhat, Debian, ... 
</para>
<para>
But we will provide additional installation information on <ulink url="http://www.otrs.org/"><citetitle>http://www.otrs.org/</citetitle></ulink>. And we are more that happy to recieve some feedback from you about how you installed OTRS on other platforms.

<question>
<para>How stable is OTRS?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Please be aware of the fact that you are dealing with a beta-version. New versions are anounced on <ulink url="http://www.otrs.org/"><citetitle>http://www.otrs.org/</citetitle></ulink>. But never the less it is quite a stable system and you shouldn't run in any trouble. But we can not guarantee it!

<question>
<para>What hardware do I need?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
We suggest an IBM s390. *SCNR* ;-)
</para>
<para>
Some of our test enviroments are Pentium II 300 with 64 MB RAM and they do a pretty good job. Of course the more RAM and the faster the CPU the better. 
</para>
</answer>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>How does OTRS scale and how big can it become?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
This is depending on the hardware and the enviroment you are using. At the moment OTRS is a one box system. With little work you can set up a webserver-cluster and you can split the database to a seperate box. We are planing to support some sort of clustering mechanism. But this is not the highest priority for the development.
</para>
<para>
There are OTRS installations which handle 20,000 tickets (e-mails) a day and don't show any sign of stress.

<question>
<para>Can I use my nice Oracle or DB2?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
At the moment we only support <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</ulink> as the default database and additionally <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostGreSQL</ulink>. Frankly we do trust in the two as much as in a DB2 (for this application). Anybody who is willing to spend some time to port it to other databases is more than welcome to the OTRS team!

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>Is it possible to generate my own ticket number format?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes it's possible. You can choose between four different OTRS formats.  
AutoIncrement ("SystemID.Counter" e. g.  1010138 or 1010139), 
Date ("Year.Month.Day.SystemID.Counter" e. g. 200206231010138 or 200206231010139),  
Random ("SystemID.Random" e. g. 100057866352 or 103745394596) and my favorite one 
DateChecksum ("Year.Month.Day.SystemID.Counter.CheckSum" e. g. 2002070110101520 and 2002070110101535). 
</para>
<para>
Further it's possible to create a own ticket number format (like you want). See the OTRS documentation.

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>More then one OTRS on one machine?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
Yes, you can do that. Just install the second, third, ... in different paths (
e.g. /opt/otrs01, /opt/otrs02, /opt/otrs03, ...). And configure the webserver 
like README.webserver.

<question>
<para>Which changes are made to my system when using the otrs4win32 installer?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
MySQL requires it's configuration file to be in the 'Windows' directory, the Start Menu entries are located somewhere in your profile. No other file outside the root directory holding all files will be written or even modified. Your system's registry will only be touched when installing some or all of the servers as a system service.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>What about the services' installations on Win32?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
We wanted to provide an installation that doesn't change much in the target system's configuration. Although a service installation dives deep into the system, we won't let you do this on your own. We decided to install any service during the installation procedure needed for OTRS to run.
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>Why should I install the servers as system services at all on Win32?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
We strongly recommend this when using OTRS. It is very convenient to have the servers running in the background without any annoying control windows. Additionally, no user has to be logged in on the machine when services are used!
</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>Is it wise to keep all files under one directory on Win32?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
There is nothing wrong with that. Some of you do not even think about those circumstances, but: There are people out there to be taken seriously when saying a mail server should reside on it's own partition, a database server should store on a RAID, a busy webserver requires a mirrored partition and so on. <emphasis>You're absolutely right</emphasis> - go on, use Windows' facilities to build all of these and other scenarios. The keywords are <emphasis>Dynamic Disks</emphasis> and <emphasis>DFS</emphasis> here. In other words, you may certainly move the subdirectories of the root directory of otrs4win32 to partitions, RAIDs or whatever you like and you are hereby encouraged to. You just have to configure your box to do it. Feel free to contact us if you need assistance whith generally setting up the Windows operating system on your box.
