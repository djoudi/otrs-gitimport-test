<question>
<para>How does OpenTRS scale?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
This is depending on the hardware and the enviroment you are using. At the moment OpenTRS is a one box system. With little work you can set up a webserver-cluster and you can split the database to a seperate box. We are planing to support some sort of clustering mechanism. But this is not the highest priority for the development.
