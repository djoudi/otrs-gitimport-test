<para>How can I delete a user, who is no longer needed? (asked by Andreas Haase - Wed, 21 Aug 2002 11:17:01 +0200 (CEST))</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
OTRS is working with database id references. If you would delete a user

Set the data record to invalid and the record is still visible (e. g. for ticket
history, ...) but not activ for the application.

Can I use OTRS only with SuSE Linux?

No, but we developed it on a SuSE Linux and frankly we did not do much testing on a Redhat, Debian, ... 
</para>
<para>
But we will provide additional installation informations on <ulink url="http://www.otrs.org/"><citetitle>http://www.otrs.org/</citetitle></ulink>. And we are more that happy to recieve some feedback from you about how you installed OTRS on other platforms.

<para>What hardware do I need?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
We suggest an IBM s390. *SCNR* ;-)

<qandaentry>
<question>
<para>How does OTRS scale and how big can it become?</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
This is depending on the hardware and the enviroment you are using. At the moment OTRS is a one box system. With little work you can set up a webserver-cluster and you can split the database to a seperate box. We are planing to support some sort of clustering mechanism. But this is not the highest priority for the development.
</para>
<para>
There are OTRS installations which handle 20,000 tickets (e-mails) a day and don't show any sign of stress.

<question>
<para>Can I use my nice Oracle or DB2?</para>
</question>
<answer>

At the moment we only support <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</ulink> as the default database.

Anybody who is willing to spend some time to port it to other databases is more than welcome to the OTRS team!

<para>Is it possible to generate my own ticket number format?</para>

<answer>
<para>
Yes it's possible. You can choose between four different OTRS formats.  
AutoIncrement ("SystemID.Counter" e. g.  1010138 or 1010139), 
Date ("Year.Month.Day.SystemID.Counter" e. g. 200206231010138 or 200206231010139),  
Random ("SystemID.Random" e. g. 100057866352 or 103745394596) and my favorite one 
DateChecksum ("Year.Month.Day.SystemID.Counter.CheckSum" e. g. 2002070110101520 and 2002070110101535). 
</para>

Further it's possible to create a own ticket number format (like you want). See the OTRS documentation.
