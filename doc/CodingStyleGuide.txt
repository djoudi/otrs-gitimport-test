In order to preserve the consistent development of OpenTRS project we 
have set up a few guidelines regarding style.

1. Formatting

TAB: We use the standard tab for spacing, equal to 4 spaces.

Braces: 
-------
 Examples:
 --
 if ($Condition) {
     Foo();
 }
 else {
     Bar();
 }

 while ($Condition == 1) {
     Foo();
 }

2. Naming
=========

Names and comments are written in English. 

Variables, Objects and Methods must be descriptive nouns or noun phrases with 
the first letter uppercase (e. g. '@TicketIDs' or '$Output' or 'BuildQueueView()').


3. Code header
==============

Attach the following header to each source file.
