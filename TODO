   http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=129
- read/unread highlighting of articles
- show agent name in CustomerTicketOverView
- GenericAgent with forward full message tree to other email address
- improve fulltext search with 'article-type'
- drop html Content-Type: multipart/alternative parts if text/plain extists
- have easy insertion into the reply of a response 'template'
- allow admin to create response templates like this:
  <SALUTATION>
  <GENERIC_BRUSH_OFF_RESPONSE>
  <SIGNATURE>
  <QUOTED_MESSAGE>
- "Ticket" Threading - http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=353
- FAQ category with permissions like queues
- ticket order by pending time
- view/search for tickets which escalate in future, e. g. in one hour
- http://bugs.otrs.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728 - Last Told
- opm package installing by click on Ticket-Attachment-
- show more Systemlog items
- formattedtext elments for the sysconfig
- include xml-attributes in the ConfigXMl, which manage if the delete or new-Buttons be shown.
- include a ticket monitoring function
- maybe could format tags in the ConfigXML be useful, simular like EISPP-DAF
- sopm: Maybe wie need tags like FileUninstall or FileDontUpdate
- ConfigOption for use other separators for e.g. comma, semicolon, colon and tabulator in the function OutputCSV
- include a check function to CustomerUserAdd and CustomerUserUpdate
  if the values a valid. A Extension of $CustomerUser->{map} with regexp
  can be the solution. Also a extension of $CustomerUser-{map} for a description
  can be useful
- Insert new attributes in the sysconfig to generate drop down menues for
  queue, status and group settings
  e.g. <String elements="Queue">Advisory</String>
  advantages: -> less operating errors in using sysconfig
              -> useful for a validity check for the sysconfigsettings
                 which came via module by the packagemanager
- SysConfig - a changelog function for the Sysconfig   or
              a function like "show all changed Configoptions"
- Queueview: insert a link or button to change quickly the viewmode of the shown tickets
- Queueview: insert a "<a name "- Tag to work through from the last edit Ticket
- accurate nameing of function attributes. For example function CustomerUserDataGet
  Change User in UserLogin or CustomerUserLogin
- SysConfig: a Descriptionfield for each SysConfigElement. That each admin can reproduce why this change of the Configuration had been done.
