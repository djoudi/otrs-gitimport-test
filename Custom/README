In case you need to modify already existing framework file for customisations,
do this in the $OTRS_HOME/Custom/ directory.

Example:

You need to modify Kernel/System/Service.pm to add an customisation, copy
Kernel/System/Service.pm to Custom/Kernel/System/Service.pm and modify it.
This module will get used.
