Documentation:
==============
  You can find quick documentation in README.* and the long version online at
  http://docu.otrs.org/.

On what hardware does it run?
=============================

  On all! You need Perl! My System is a Pentium II 500 with 256 MB RAM and
  a 8 GB SCSI Harddisk. I can easily handle ~120.000 tickets, without problems.
  For more then ~120.000 or ~300 tickets a day please ask the list about the
  requirements.

Software requirements?
======================

  On all Perl-Platforms! You need:
    * min. Perl5
    * Database (e. g. MySQL)
    * Webpserver (mod_perl isn't required but very nice to have)
    * A MTA (e. g. Sendmail or Postfix)

  Currently tested:

    * SuSE Linux 7.0 (i386), Perl 5, MySQL 3.22.32 and Apache 1.3.12.
    * SuSE Linux 7.2 (i386), Perl 5.6.0, MySQL 3.23.37 and Apache 1.3.19.
