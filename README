Documentation:
==============
  You can find quick documentation in README.* and the long version online at
  http://docu.otrs.org/.

On what hardware does it run?
=============================

  On all! You need Perl! My System is a Pentium II 500 with 256 MB RAM and
  a 8 GB SCSI Harddisk. I can easily handle ~150.000 tickets, without problems.
  For more then ~150.000 or ~400 tickets a day please ask the list about the
  requirements.

  The biggest OTRS setup (where we got feedback) is ~750.000 tickets, ~4.200.000 
  articles and ~12.000.000 ticket-history database table records. This system is 
  running with MySQL, Apache and mod_perl on a Linux box with Pentium III 800 Mhz, 
  256 MB RAM, SCSI.

Software requirements?
======================

  On all Perl-Platforms! You need:
    * min. Perl5
    * Database (e. g. MySQL)
    * Webpserver (mod_perl isn't required but very nice to have)
    * A MTA (e. g. Sendmail or Postfix)

  Currently tested:

    * SuSE Linux 7.0 (i386), Perl 5, MySQL 3.22.32 and Apache 1.3.12.
    * SuSE Linux 7.2 (i386), Perl 5.6.0, MySQL 3.23.37 and Apache 1.3.19.
    * SuSE Linux 7.3 (s390), Perl 5.6.0, MySQL 3.23.48 and Apache 1.3.22.
    * SuSE Linux 8.0 (i386), Perl 5.6.1, MySQL 3.23.48 and Apache 1.3.23 (incl. mod_perl 1.26).
    * SuSE Linux 8.0 (i386), Perl 5.6.1, MySQL 3.23.48 and Roxen-Webserver 2.2.252
    * SuSE Linux 8.0 (i386) interfacing with Exchange 5.5 via fetchmail and postfix   
    * Redhat 7.3 (i386) (no detail description available)
    * Mandrake 8.2 server (i386) interfacing with Lotus Notes mail server via fetchmail and sendmail
    * FreeBSD (i386), Sendmail, Perl 5.6.1, MySQL and Apache. 
    ... and you? ;-)
